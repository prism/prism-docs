v4 versus v3
============

Prism version 4 is a **complete** rewrite. We're retiring the original Prism codebase which started in 2012.

This new version aims to correct all of the problems with the old product including saner permissions, better database support, better configuration, better support for modern Minecraft, more flexibility, etc.

Upgrading
^^^^^^^^^

Unfortunately there is no way to convert between v3 databases and v4. Prism v4 works very differently from v3.

Data is serialized differently, non-player causes were handled differently, etc.

Prism 4 needs a clean start.
