Recommendations
---------------

Preventing griefing is the first step in protecting your server.

Prism is the tool you need to handle griefing after it's occurred.

We strongly recommend setting up a robust protection system to complement Prism. We recommend `GriefDefender <https://docs.griefdefender.com/>`_.
